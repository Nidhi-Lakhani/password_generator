# password_generator
 
The objective of this project is to create a password generator using python. The Password generator tool creates a random and customized password for users that helps them to create a strong password which provides greater security.

In this project, the user has to select the password length and then click on the “Generate Password” button. It will show the generated password below. If the user clicks on the “Copy To Clipboard” button, then it will copy the password automatically. To build this project we will use the python modules of Tkinter, random, strings and pyperclip.

## Tkinter 
is a standard GUI library and is one of the easiest ways to build a GUI application. 

## Pyperclip 
module allows us to copy and paste text to and from the clipboard to your computer. 

## Random 
module can generate random numbers and 

## String 
module contains a number of functions to process the standard python string.
